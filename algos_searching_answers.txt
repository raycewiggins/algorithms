1. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
I would use a linear iterative solution because binary doesn't work on an unsorted collection. And I would write it iteratively because it's more easily understood code and quicker to write.

2. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
Given a sorted collection, I would use a iterative binary algorithm. Again, iterative solutions are easier to write, and easier to understand although not as elegant. Binary because it works much faster on a sorted collection.
